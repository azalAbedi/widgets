# Widgets App

A Widget application that includes multiple components. These components include: an Accordion, a Wikipedia API search, a Dropdown item selection, and a Google Translate API.

This app uses custom navigation with JS and React (without a third-party library like React Router), which is used to navigate between the different widget components.
